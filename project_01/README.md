# Capstone Project Plan
Inventory Manager
## Overview
    I work as a cook in a restaurant, and we are constantly resupplying our
inventory. The manager has to count stock and place orders several times a week among
multiple vendors. Not only is this a time consuming process, it is also prone to
errors. Keeping track of figures on a printout with pencil is ineffective and could
result in a loss of sales or a secondary supply order.
    So I am developing an inventory manager app that will allow the user to enter
and store inventory items and quantities in a friendly way with options to categorize
and count items. Vendor information can be stored and linked to each item.
Orders will be able to be created for each vendor. Inventory will be tracked, and
that data will provide help for the ordering process. Then, the order can be sent
to the vendor and placed into inventory when received. Overall, time spent
counting and ordering will be lessened along with being more accurate.
## Features
User Login: Users authenticate to keep data private.

Send Orders: Users will be able to send an order to a vendor via email or text.

Order Suggestions: Inventory items will appear on the order draft whose quantity
        falls below a threshold.

Count Items: Users will be able to enter quantities based on a category or by
    vendor allowing grouping for convenience.
