# Attend a Meetup

#### Meetup Details
* St. Louis PowerShell User Group
* December 21, 2017 6:30PM
* Using PowerShell and Pester for operational validation testing.

#### Description of Meetup
We had a guest speaker, Mike Robbins, a Microsoft MVP. He spoke of using Pester
with PowerShell to do automated unit testing in Test Driven Development (TTD)
which writes small scope tests and then develops small scope code in order to pass
these tests. We were presented with examples of basic functionality and the
reasoning behind them. Finally, he demonstrated how to automate operational
readiness and operational validation testing of servers and the systems in the
environment that depend on them.


#### Questions
Q: What kinds of general tests are usually written?
A: Tests are written for anything you would have to test manually. Also, if there
   are previous problems one has encountered, they can check for them as well.
   A checklist of these errors prepared in advance was suggested to be helpful.

Q: When would these be of use?
A: Updating software can produce errors, and a checklist of tests can quickly
   find any operational error, and that issue can be addressed more readily.
   Also, specific tests can reduce the scope of the problem to narrow down
   and correct the issue.
